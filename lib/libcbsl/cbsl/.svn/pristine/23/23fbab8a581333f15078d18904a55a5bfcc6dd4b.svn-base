/** \file	rwlock.h
 * \brief	This module implements Read-Write Locks
 * \details	Read Write Locks allow multiple access to shared data for reading
 *			while granting exclusive access for writing.
 *			When a consumer tries to aquire a read lock on a resource, if
 *			the resource is not locked for writing, the lock is granted and
 *			the consumer may proceed. If more than one consumer try to acquire
 *			the read lock without any active read lock, all consumers are
 *			granted the lock and proceed normally. This hapens so because
 *			read operations do not modify the data and, as so, multiple
 *			processes or threads can be given access to the same data without
 *			the risk of contention.
 *			In the simplest implementation, writers, will be held of for as
 *			long as there are read locks active. As new readers are not held
 *			off, the writer may hang forever waiting for a lock.
 *			The \a RWLock class behaves in a manner that read locks are not
 *			granted if there are threads waiting for a write lock, so that
 *			writers have access to the data to be written without starvation.
